# RSA Factoring Challenge

## Introduction

This project is a RSA Factoring Challenge, where the goal is to efficiently factorize large semiprime numbers. The RSA algorithm's security relies on the difficulty of factoring the product of two large prime numbers, and this challenge aims to explore and implement efficient factorization techniques.

## Requirements

### General
- Implement the solution in the programming language of your choice.
- The operating system used should be Standard Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.

### Resources
- [RSA](link_to_rsa_info)
- [How does HTTPS provide security?](link_to_https_info)
- [Prime Factorization](link_to_prime_factorization_info)
- [Why RSA?](link_to_why_rsa_info)

## Implementation

Describe the algorithms and techniques you plan to use for prime factorization. Consider the efficiency and scalability of your solution.

## Usage

Provide instructions on how to run your code and factorize a sample RSA key. Include any dependencies or special considerations.

```bash
# Example usage command
./factorize_rsa.py --key 1234567890123456789012345678901234567890
